# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 

The purpose of the analysis was to look into the collected ride sharing data for each city type. In the anaylysis we look into total rides,	total drivers,	total fares,	average fare per ride,	average fare per driver for the specified city type.

## Results 

Some of the insights we get from the data collected is that the price of Average Fare Per Driver is increased as the number of drivers decreases. In the images below we can see that reflection in the rural row where they have the lowest driver count but hightes average drive fare.

Below we see a line chart that displays the total fare by city type. We notice that rural and suburban city types maitain a relatively consistent progression of fare throughout the listed months. Urban city types have the highest fare amounts but here we see that there is a bit more volitility as the prices fluctuate a bit more within the months of end of Febuary to April. 

We also notice that all city types have a similar spike in fare amounts towards the end of Febuary and that suburban fares are the only city type that consistently increases throughout the end of April.

## Summary 

Some suggestions to look into with each city type:

1. Urban - Look into what causes such volitility in fare for the months of end of Febuary - April
2. Suburban - A good question to ask here, is what causes this city to perform differently than the other types for the month of april
3. Rural - I would suggest looking into the month of January and figuring out why this city type starts so low in fare amounts.
